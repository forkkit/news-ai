NewsAI Instagram

API use case:

NewsAI is building products for public relations professionals to be able to improve some parts of their day-to-day workflows. The first tool we’re building is to allow PR professionals to be able to keep track of the influencers they reach out to for their brand. For example, if you’re a PR professional and your client is Equionix then you are tracking ~1000 different instagram influencers for them. You’re running analytics and looking for when they are posting about health + fitness so you could reach out to them. We’re building a system to help them be able to do exactly this in one particular place. We want to pull in feeds of Instagram influencers that they’re following and let PR professionals keep track of notable posts that the influencers write. We will also be running data analytics on what types of posts they are writing so we can help filter down the list of influencers for them.

They already very strongly use instagram, and we just want to make it easier for them to be able to keep track and keep their content up to date on a day-to-day basis. We believe a lot in the power of instagram for PR professionals, and we want to help make the ties stronger. A lot of our PR clients are needing to follow 10,000+ instagram accounts for many different clients. Our tool just allows them to know when their influencers have posted, run analytics on what type of content influencers are writing about and if they post about their clients, and uses basic techniques to filter down the influencers they should potentially reach out to.

In the video you see we present a media list management tool. It’s basically like a CRM integrated with social profiles of influencers they follow. Instagram is our key network since it’s incredibly powerful in the PR world. We’re building our product around instagram - with respect to the policies.

Currently, a lot of PR professionals visit each of the Instagram pages of influencers they are tracking on a weekly basis to see new posts or content that is coming out. We want to make this much easier for them so the can still interact with Instagram data & platform, but in a way that is much easier for them.
