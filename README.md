# news-ai

A specification for building NewsAI

### What is NewsAI?

Exploring the long-term changes that can happen in the consumption and creation of news through the emergance of AI techniques, and advancements in Machine Learning.

### Long-term projects that can built

- Giving context to articles discussed on Facebook Messenger. Similar to the @fbchess. Gives you an overview of the current afairs news by doing @currentnews or @news <URL> which gives you back a summary and some contextual information.
- Consumer Apps:
  - A new experience of reading the news. It provides not just the news article, but contextual information on top of it.
  - A way for consumers to want to stay updated on a news topic. This is if you want to stay updated to the ISIS bombing. We know that ISIS bombing is a "topic" in the database that has several "articles" underneath it. Then when a new article is added to that topic you can push to that user.
  - Catch up on X or something like "You missed news X" while you were gone. 

### Problems

- There's a lot of news. How can you get it, analyze it, and use it to predict things?
- How can you model things like Timelines and key topics that occur in news?
