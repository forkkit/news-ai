	"basic_summary": "It happened Saturday morning along Interstate 80 in Richmond, just like it's happened up to five other times since November in the same place.\nCalifornia Highway Patrol spokesman Daniel Hill described each of these shootings as targeted, meaning the gunmen likely weren't aiming at just any vehicle and that all drivers shouldn't fear being shot.\nStill, the dangers are obvious not just to those who have been shot or could be shot in the future.\nThat's why California authorities are seeking witnesses -- whether they were on Interstate 80 around the time of any of these incidents or know something about the people responsible.\nNo one wants to cruise 65 mph along a highway and have bullets pelt the car next to them, which might slam into them with the driver wounded and possibly incapacitated.",
